# Medieval Hillfort - Research Results

After five years of intensive archaeological research at a medieval hillfort in South Moravia, we present the most important findings that change the view of early medieval fortifications in our territory.

## About the Site

The hillfort is located on a strategic hill above the confluence of two rivers. Its advantageous position enabled control of important trade routes.

### Historical Context

- **Period** - 9th-10th century AD
- **Cultural classification** - Great Moravian Empire
- **Function** - Administrative and military center
- **Area** - Approximately 12 hectares

## Research Methods

### Non-destructive Research
Before excavation, we used modern methods:

- **Aerial archaeology** - Drone photography and LiDAR scanning
- **Geophysical survey** - Magnetometry and ground-penetrating radar
- **3D modeling** - Digital terrain model creation

### Excavation
Systematic excavation revealed:

- Fortification system
- Dwelling structures
- Workshop areas
- Religious buildings

## Main Discoveries

### Fortifications
The fortification system consisted of:

1. **Outer rampart** - Earth rampart with wooden structures
2. **Stone wall** - Inner fortification of stone
3. **Gates** - Three entrances with complex security system
4. **Moat** - Defensive moat around the entire perimeter

### Buildings
Within the hillfort were found:

- **Rotunda** - Stone sacral building
- **Palace** - Representative building of the ruler
- **Craftsmen's quarters** - Evidence of specialized production
- **Storage facilities** - Large storage capacity

### Finds

The find collection includes:

| Category | Number | Significance |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| Ceramic vessels | 3,247 | High |
| Metal objects | 891 | Very high |
| Coins | 124 | Exceptional |
| Jewelry | 456 | High |

## New Knowledge

Research brought significant findings:

### Architecture
- More advanced fortification system than previously thought
- Evidence of influence from Carolingian architecture
- Stone construction earlier than expected

### Economy
- Developed craft production (pottery, metalworking)
- Evidence of long-distance trade
- Minting of own coins

### Society
- Clearly stratified society
- Evidence of literacy (inscriptions on pottery)
- Christian influence (rotunda, crosses)

## Preservation and Presentation

The hillfort is now:

- **Protected monument** - Declared a national cultural monument
- **Accessible to public** - Educational trails and information boards
- **Museum** - Local museum with exhibition of finds
- **Events** - Regular guided tours and historical performances

## Continuation of Research

In the coming years we plan:

1. **Complete publication** - Scientific monograph about the site
2. **Virtual reconstruction** - 3D visualization of the hillfort
3. **Further excavation** - Focus on unexcavated areas
4. **International cooperation** - Comparison with foreign hillforts

## Visit

The hillfort is open to the public:

- **Opening hours** - April-October, daily 9:00-17:00
- **Admission** - Adults 100 CZK, reduced 50 CZK
- **Guided tours** - By arrangement
