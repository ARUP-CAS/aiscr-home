# Digitization of Archaeological Collections

As part of the modernization of archaeological information systems, an ambitious collection digitization project has been launched. The goal is to make thousands of archaeological finds accessible to the general public and experts through modern technologies.

## Technologies Used

### 3D Scanning
The most significant finds are documented using 3D scanning, which allows:

- **Detailed viewing** - Users can view artifacts from all angles
- **Measurement** - Ability to precisely measure dimensions
- **Virtual exhibitions** - Creating online expositions

### Photogrammetry
For smaller objects we use photogrammetry:

- High-resolution images
- Automatic processing
- Rapid documentation

## Current Project Status

To date, the following have been digitized:

| Category | Number of Items | Status |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| Bronze objects | 1,247 | ‚úÖ Completed |
| Ceramics | 3,891 | üîÑ In progress |
| Stone tools | 2,156 | ‚è≥ Planned |
| Coins | 5,432 | ‚è≥ Planned |

## Access to Digital Collections

Digitized finds are available through our online catalog. Each record contains:

- Detailed description of the find
- Photographic documentation
- 3D model (where available)
- Information about the find location
- Dating and cultural context

## Future Plans

In the coming months we plan to:

1. **Expansion of 3D models** - Digitization of other significant finds
2. **Mobile application** - Development of an app for smartphones and tablets
3. **Virtual reality** - Experimenting with VR technologies
4. **API for developers** - Making data available for external applications

## Collaboration with Institutions

The project is being carried out in cooperation with:

- National Museum
- Moravian Museum
- Universities across the country
- Regional museums

*More information about digital collections can be found in our online catalog.*
