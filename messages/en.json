		"title": "About Us",
		"intro": "The Archaeological Information System of the Czech Republic (AIS CR) was established as a long-term project of the Czech Academy of Sciences in Prague and Brno. Since 2016, it has been part of the Roadmap for Large Research Infrastructures of the Czech Republic. It is thus long-term financially supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic.",
		"quote": "The goal of AIS CR is to professionally manage, make accessible, and permanently preserve data from archaeological field excavations from the territory of the Czech Republic and build a digital ecosystem for Czech archaeology.",
		"feature1": "We cover <strong>archaeological data</strong> from the earliest excavations in the 19th century to currently ongoing research.",
		"feature2": "We preserve physical and digital records and make them accessible through online tools, in context and without unnecessary barriers. We thus create a <strong>trustworthy digital repository</strong>.",
		"feature3": "We digitally process <strong>documents collected since 1919</strong> and continuously oversee the quality of records and documentation of currently ongoing archaeological excavations.",
		"feature4": "We improve record quality by linking related documents, supplementing missing older data, and building authority lists of <strong>archaeological excavations and sites</strong>.",
		"feature5": "We follow the <strong>latest trends</strong> in digital data management (digital curation) and support the implementation of technological innovations.",
		"feature6": "We bring <strong>standards</strong> based on internationally recognized FAIR principles and interdisciplinary <strong>research data management environments</strong> to the Czech archaeological community.",
		"feature7": "We recognize the diversity of our <strong>user base</strong> – from professional and amateur communities through public administration to the general public – and adapt the form and focus of our tools accordingly.",
		"feature8": "We strive for AIS CR data to be <strong>part of the linked web</strong>, i.e., standardized and technically compatible with other information systems, and to be discoverable internationally.",
		"feature9": "We maintain an <strong>expert team</strong> that manages data, develops application tools, and develops the necessary digital skills of our users.",
		"feature10": "We help understand the <strong>role of archaeology in society</strong> and purposefully strengthen the use of research results in practice.",
		"whyTitle": "Why is AIS CR Irreplaceable?",
		"whyQuote": "Unique and irreplaceable archaeological data deserve professional care – that's why AIS CR exists.",
		"whyExplanation": "Most field archaeological excavations use destructive methods and usually take place at future construction sites. Without conducting the excavation, there would be a risk that relics of the past – remnants of settlements, burial grounds, and other manifestations of human activity in the past – would be irreversibly destroyed during construction. Only the finds and documentation obtained during archaeological excavations remain. Museums care for the finds. We care for the records and data.",
		"whoTitle": "Who Creates AIS CR?",
		"whoQuote": "We are an expert team with deep knowledge of the field – data is safe with AIS CR.",
		"whoExplanation": "AIS CR is coordinated by the Institute of Archaeology of the CAS, Brno (ARÚB Archive, where datasets and archival fund for Moravia and Czech Silesia are managed) together with the Institute of Archaeology of the CAS, Prague (Department of Information Resources and Landscape Archaeology ARÚ with management for the territory of Bohemia).",
