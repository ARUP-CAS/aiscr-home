Since 2016, it has been part of the <a href=\"https://www.vyzkumne-infrastruktury.cz/en/roadmap-of-large-research-infrastructures-of-the-czech-republic/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"underline\">Roadmap of Large Research Infrastructures of the Czech Republic</a> and has been continuously funded by the <a href=\"https://msmt.gov.cz/?lang=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"underline\">Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports</a>.",
	"about.quote": "The mission of the AIS CR is to professionally curate, provide access to, and permanently preserve data from archaeological fieldwork in the Czech Republic, while building a digital ecosystem for Czech archaeology.",
	"about.feature1": "We cover <strong>archaeological data</strong> from the earliest 19th-century excavations to current research projects.",
	"about.feature2": "As a <strong>trusted digital repository</strong>, we preserve physical and digital records and make them easily accessible online. We ensure they are clearly structured, contextualised, and free of unnecessary barriers.",
	"about.feature3": "We digitise <strong>documents accumulated since 1919,</strong> while also continuously overseeing the quality of the records and new documentation from current archaeological excavations and surveys.",
	"about.feature4": "We improve record quality by linking related documents, adding missing older data, and building authoritative lists of <strong>archaeological excavations and sites</strong>.",
	"about.feature5": "We follow the <strong>latest trends</strong> in digital data management (digital curation) and promote the adoption of technological innovations.",
	"about.feature6": "We introduce internationally recognised <a href=\"https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"underline\">FAIR principles</a> and interdisciplinary <a href=\"https://www.eosc.cz/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"underline\">research data management</a> <strong>standards</strong> into Czech archaeology.",

	"about.whyExplanation": "Most fieldwork is destructive in nature and usually takes place at construction sites. Without excavation, evidence of the past – settlements, cemeteries, and other traces of human activity – would be permanently lost. What remains are the portable finds and documentation produced during the research. Museums take care of the artefacts. We take care of the records and data.",

	"faq.a1": "All archaeological fieldwork is recorded in the <a href=\"https://amcr-info.aiscr.cz/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"underline\">Archaeological Map of the Czech Republic</a>. Its content can be browsed and viewed through the <a href=\"https://digiarchiv.aiscr.cz/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"underline\">Digital Archive of the AMCR</a>, which provides access to information on excavations, sites, and finds recorded by the Institutes of Archaeology of the Czech Academy of Sciences in Brno and Prague from 1919 to the present. We recommend signing up – creating a user account will give you access to more detailed information. A guide on how to use the Digital Archive effectively can be found <a href=\"https://amcr-help.aiscr.cz/digiarchiv/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"underline\">here</a>.",
	"faq.q2": "Archaeology is my hobby. Can I get involved in fieldwork as an amateur?",
	"faq.a2": "In the Czech Republic, participation in archaeological fieldwork is only possible under the supervision of a professional archaeologist from an <a href=\"https://oao.aiscr.cz/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"underline\">authorised archaeological organisation</a>. On the <a href=\"https://amcr-info.aiscr.cz/pas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"underline\">AMCR website</a>, you can find all the necessary information on how to legally engage in surface collections or metal detector surveys, and which AIS CR tools are right for you. The Portal of Amateur Collaborators and the Register of Individual Finds (AMCR-PAS) is the main application for reporting activities within such collaborations. The records are subsequently published in the Digital Archive under the <a href=\"https://digiarchiv.aiscr.cz/results?entity=samostatny_nalez\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"underline\">Individual Finds</a> tab.",
	"faq.q3": "Where can you discover archaeological finds in the Czech Republic?",
	"faq.a3": "Practically the entire territory of the Czech Republic is considered archaeologically significant. This includes areas where past human activity has already been documented, as well as places that have not yet been explored, meaning the presence of undiscovered archaeological remains cannot be ruled out. The only exception is areas demonstrably destroyed, such as exploited surface mines or sandpits. The <a href=\"https://isad.npu.cz/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"underline\">National Heritage Institute</a> maintains the basic register of sites with archaeological records.",
	"faq.q4": "Where is archaeological research required? Is it mandatory?",
	"faq.a4": "Archaeological research is required in any area threatened by groundworks, even if it is not a known archaeological site with a high concentration of finds. The decision is professionally assessed by the Institutes of Archaeology of the Czech Academy of Sciences in <a href=\"https://www.arup.cas.cz/referat-archeologicke-pamatkove-pece/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"underline\">Prague</a> and <a href=\"https://www.arub.cz/en/archeological-services/information-for-builders/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"underline\">Brno</a>, or by another authorised archaeological organisation. Their overview is available in the <a href=\"https://oao.aiscr.cz/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"underline\">Map of Archaeological Organisations</a>.",
	"faq.q5": "Do I really always have a legal duty to report construction activities or other groundworks? What is the best way to do it?",
	"faq.a5": "Yes. Anyone planning construction or any groundworks within the Czech Republic (with the exception of areas demonstrably destroyed – see the question above) is legally obliged to notify the Institutes of Archaeology in Brno or Prague. The best way to do so is through the Archaeological Map of the Czech Republic by submitting the <a href=\"https://amcr.aiscr.cz/oznameni/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"underline\">notification form in advance</a>.",
	"faq.q6": "I am planning a construction project, and I need to find an institution to conduct the archaeological excavation. How should I proceed?",
	"faq.a6": "Organisations authorised to carry out excavations are listed in the <a href=\"https://oao.aiscr.cz/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"underline\">Map of Archaeological Organisations</a>. Simply click on your area of interest, and you will see which organisations operate there. Their websites provide details for archaeologists you can contact. Always report the planned works via this <a href=\"https://archeologickamapa.cz/oznameni\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"underline\">online form</a> – this ensures your legal obligation is met. Notifying only an organisation instead of the Institute of Archaeology is not sufficient unless they file the official notification on your behalf. You will then agree on the conditions and scope of the excavation directly with the selected organisation.",
	"faq.q7": "Can I browse and view artefacts from excavations or surveys online?",
	"faq.a7": "Yes. The <a href=\"https://digiarchiv.aiscr.cz/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"underline\">Digital Archive of the AMCR</a> provides access to fieldwork reports, often including photographs of selected artefacts. Finds resulting from collaboration between professional and amateur archaeologists can also be viewed there, under the <a href=\"https://digiarchiv.aiscr.cz/results?entity=samostatny_nalez\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"underline\">Individual Finds</a> tab. Some finds are even available as 3D scans, which can be explored in the <a href=\"https://digiarchiv.aiscr.cz/results?entity=knihovna_3d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"underline\">3D Library</a>.",
	"faq.q8": "Do I need to acknowledge using AIS CR in my work?",
	"faq.a8": "Yes. If you use the AIS CR tools or data, you must reference them in your outputs. Always refer to the specific tool or dataset. If you are reporting your outputs in the <a href=\"https://www.isvavai.cz/riv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"underline\">Information Register of R&D Results</a> (RIV), make sure to select the relevant AIS CR project under the <em>LRI</em> (Large Research Infrastructures) field – always the one with the highest sequence number. This allows us to properly document and report achieved outcomes to the public funding provider. Details on how to use our services can be found in the <a href=\"#terms\" class=\"underline\">AIS CR's terms of use</a>.",
	"faq.q9": "Can archaeological sites be visited? Is there a selection or map of recommended ones?",
	"faq.a9": "Yes. You can easily plan trips to archaeological sites using the <a href=\"https://www.archeologickyatlas.cz/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"underline\">Archaeological Atlas of the Czech Republic</a>. It provides descriptions, photographs, site plans, and GPS coordinates. Sites are listed alphabetically and can also be filtered by type or archaeological period, or simply explored through the interactive map. A wider list of sites, along with their documentation, can also be found in the Digital Archive of the AMCR under the <a href=\"https://digiarchiv.aiscr.cz/results?entity=lokalita\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"underline\">Sites</a> tab.",
	"faq.q10": "Where can I find out what is new in the AIS CR or what is being planned?",
