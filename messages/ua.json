	"about": {
		"title": "About Us",
		"intro": "The Archaeological Information System of the Czech Republic (AIS CR) was established as a long-term project of the Czech Academy of Sciences in Prague and Brno. Since 2016, it has been part of the Roadmap for Large Research Infrastructures of the Czech Republic. It is thus long-term financially supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic.",
		"quote": "The goal of AIS CR is to professionally manage, make accessible, and permanently preserve data from archaeological field excavations from the territory of the Czech Republic and build a digital ecosystem for Czech archaeology.",
		"feature1": "We cover <strong>archaeological data</strong> from the earliest excavations in the 19th century to currently ongoing research.",
		"feature2": "We preserve physical and digital records and make them accessible through online tools, in context and without unnecessary barriers. We thus create a <strong>trustworthy digital repository</strong>.",
		"feature3": "We digitally process <strong>documents collected since 1919</strong> and continuously oversee the quality of records and documentation of currently ongoing archaeological excavations.",
		"feature4": "We improve record quality by linking related documents, supplementing missing older data, and building authority lists of <strong>archaeological excavations and sites</strong>.",
		"feature5": "We follow the <strong>latest trends</strong> in digital data management (digital curation) and support the implementation of technological innovations.",
		"feature6": "We bring <strong>standards</strong> based on internationally recognized FAIR principles and interdisciplinary <strong>research data management environments</strong> to the Czech archaeological community.",
		"feature7": "We recognize the diversity of our <strong>user base</strong> – from professional and amateur communities through public administration to the general public – and adapt the form and focus of our tools accordingly.",
		"feature8": "We strive for AIS CR data to be <strong>part of the linked web</strong>, i.e., standardized and technically compatible with other information systems, and to be discoverable internationally.",
		"feature9": "We maintain an <strong>expert team</strong> that manages data, develops application tools, and develops the necessary digital skills of our users.",
		"feature10": "We help understand the <strong>role of archaeology in society</strong> and purposefully strengthen the use of research results in practice.",
		"whyTitle": "Why is AIS CR Irreplaceable?",
		"whyQuote": "Unique and irreplaceable archaeological data deserve professional care – that's why AIS CR exists.",
		"whyExplanation": "Most field archaeological excavations use destructive methods and usually take place at future construction sites. Without conducting the excavation, there would be a risk that relics of the past – remnants of settlements, burial grounds, and other manifestations of human activity in the past – would be irreversibly destroyed during construction. Only the finds and documentation obtained during archaeological excavations remain. Museums care for the finds. We care for the records and data.",
		"whoTitle": "Who Creates AIS CR?",
		"whoQuote": "We are an expert team with deep knowledge of the field – data is safe with AIS CR.",
		"whoExplanation": "AIS CR is coordinated by the Institute of Archaeology of the CAS, Brno (ARÚB Archive, where datasets and archival fund for Moravia and Czech Silesia are managed) together with the Institute of Archaeology of the CAS, Prague (Department of Information Resources and Landscape Archaeology ARÚ with management for the territory of Bohemia).",

	"faq": {
		"title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
		"q1": "I am interested in archaeological research. Where can I find information about it?",
		"a1": "Information about archaeological research can be found in the Archaeological Map of the Czech Republic (AMČR). The system contains a database of all registered archaeological activities, including their location, chronological classification, and basic results. You can search by locality, period, or type of research.",
		"q2": "Archaeology is my hobby, and I want to cooperate as an amateur in archaeological research. Is this possible?",
		"a2": "Yes, it is possible through the AMČR-PAS system (Portal for Amateur Collaborators). This system allows for the registration of volunteers, recording of finds, and coordination of cooperation between amateurs and professional archaeologists. It is necessary to follow legal procedures and cooperate with authorized archaeological organizations.",
		"q3": "Where are areas with archaeological finds located in the Czech Republic?",
		"a3": "Archaeological finds are located practically throughout the entire territory of the Czech Republic. The density of finds varies by region and historical settlement. Most finds are recorded in areas with long-term continuous settlement, such as fertile lowlands and river valleys. Precise information can be found in the AMČR map applications.",
		"q4": "In what area is archaeological research required? And is it mandatory at all?",
		"a4": "Archaeological research is mandatory according to Act No. 20/1987 Coll., on State Heritage Care, in areas with archaeological finds during construction activities. The obligation applies to the entire territory of the Czech Republic, with the intensity of research depending on the archaeological potential of the specific locality. Research is carried out only by authorized archaeological organizations.",
		"q5": "Do I always have an obligation to submit a notification of a construction plan or other terrain intervention according to the heritage law? What is the best way?",
		"a5": "Yes, according to § 22 of Act No. 20/1987 Coll., it is mandatory to notify construction plans and terrain interventions to the relevant archaeological institute. The simplest way is electronic submission through the AMČR portal, where you will find forms and instructions. Notification must be submitted at least 30 days before the start of work.",
		"q6": "I am planning construction and looking for an institution that can carry out archaeological research. How should I proceed?",
		"a6": "Use the Map of Authorized Archaeological Organizations (Map OAO), where you will find an overview of all organizations authorized to carry out archaeological research in specific regions. Each organization has a defined territorial scope and contact details. We recommend contacting multiple organizations to compare offers.",
		"q7": "Can I view archaeological finds from research online?",
		"a7": "Yes, many archaeological finds are available online through the AMČR Digital Archive and the 3D Library. These platforms contain photographic documentation, 3D models of selected artifacts, and detailed descriptions of finds. Access to some materials may be restricted due to cultural heritage protection.",
		"q8": "Do I need to state anywhere that I used AIS CR in my work?",
		"a8": "Yes, when using data or tools from AIS CR in publications, research, or presentations, it is necessary to provide proper citation. This helps track the impact of the system and ensures research transparency. Specific citation formats can be found in the documentation of individual tools.",
		"q9": "Can archaeological sites be visited? And is there a selection or map of recommended ones?",
		"a9": "Some archaeological sites are publicly accessible, while others are protected, and visits are restricted. We recommend using the Archaeological Atlas, which contains information about publicly accessible sites, including practical visiting information. Always respect protective measures and site manager instructions.",
		"q10": "Where can I find out what's new in AIS CR or what you're planning?",
		"a10": "Current information about news and planned features can be found on our blog, in the newsletter, and on social media. We regularly publish articles about new features, system updates, and upcoming projects. You can also subscribe to our newsletter.",
